### Project Introduction
Create an interactive web application Bio Blocks for the project of "Amino Acid 3D Structure Learning Set," 
designed to facilitate student learning of the 3D structures of amino acids. 
This project aims to provide an engaging platform for exploration and understanding through 3D models, 
allowing users to download customized Lego-style pieces for hands-on learning and 3D printing.
